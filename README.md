# Manager
Manager App


# Currently known issues:

"passport" keeps forcing an "email" to be unique and users without email can be treated as duplicates
There is noway  to reset a password rightnow
Still needs to find a way to set a Superuser at init time

# Important notes:

* ONLY Admins and Super users can create users so you need to manullay issue an admin from your mongo side

* Still need to implement queries for the whole app.
